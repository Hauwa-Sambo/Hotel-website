## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes using media queries.
- **Custom Properties**: Utilizes CSS variables for theme colors, making it easy to adjust the overall color scheme.
- **Modern Typography**: Uses "montserrat" fonts for a modern and clean look.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hauwa-Sambo/Hotel-website.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Hotel-website
   ```

3. **Open the HTML File**:
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage

- The CSS file (`styles.css`) includes various sections with classes that define the layout and styles for the web page.
- To make any adjustments, edit the `styles.css` file, and the changes will reflect on the web page upon refreshing the browser.
- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) renders repetitive sections (choose us, special offer, review, Recent posts) dynamically. And renders the hamburger menu.
